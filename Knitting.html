<h2>Why Learn to Knit?</h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Knitting is an essential way to bring people together by sharing resources to make beautiful objects. It
allows you to share the resources you have to bring other together by helping them. Not only that, but it
is a large stress reliever. You can use your creativity to make whatever you want, with a large array of colors,
patterns, and techniques.</h3>
<h4>How Can You Start?</h4>

<h5>Learning how to knit is as simple as going to your local craft store, buying the things you need,
and learning a few simple instructions from a pattern or a fellow friend. But there are many things beginning
knitters dont know they need, so I will help you out. The two most important things you need are obviously
needles and yarn, but there is more to that than finding two needles and a color you like.
<br>
<br>
First, you need to find a type of yarn you like. When you are picking out yarn, look for colors you like and
imagine it on the product you will be making. Keep in mind not to pick out a novelty yarn,because they are
harder to knit with. Once you have chosen a suitable yarn, I found rub it on your arms or neck to feel the texture.
If it feels itchy, dont get it. You won't like knitting with it, and you definitely won't like knitting with it.
Once you finally find what you think is the perfect yarn, you will need to check the label. Among a few other
symbols, there will be be a square with a drawing of knitting needles within it. There will be a number next to it,
and that number tells you what size knitting needles you will need to use. Once you locate what size needles you
need to use for your specified type of yarn, you can go and retrieve those needles, whether you will take them 
from your inventory or go out and buy them.

<br>
<br>
Knitting needles and yarn are the two main things you need. But there are a few other small things that will make
your knitting experience just a little bit easier. One of those items are knitting needle caps. They go on the top
of your knitting needles, so your stitches don't fall off when you set down your needles. Once last knitting essential
that will be very helpful towards you will be a crochet needle. You will not use this to actually knit, but instead to
fix mistakes and end off your project.</h5>
